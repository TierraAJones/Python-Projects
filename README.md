# Python-Projects

This repository will include personal projects I have created using Python. The repository will have three tiers (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced) based on the level of the coding projects. I gained the ability to code Python by taking an online course, reading an e-book, and look how-to tutorials on GitHub. I will add files to this consistently as I continuely improve on my Python coding skills.
